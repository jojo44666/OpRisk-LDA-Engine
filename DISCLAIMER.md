## ⚠️ Disclaimer: Educational Use Only

This software is a theoretical implementation of the **Loss Distribution Approach (LDA)** for Operational Risk modeling. It is intended strictly for **educational and research purposes**.

### Limitations
1. **Synthetic Data:** The default execution uses synthetically generated loss data (Poisson/Lognormal/Pareto mix) and does not reflect the proprietary loss history of any actual financial institution.
2. **Model Risk:** While this project utilizes industry-standard distributions (GPD, Poisson), it does not account for correlation between different risk types (Copulas) or external data mixing, which are required for a fully compliant Basel III Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) framework.
3. **No Financial Advice:** The Value-at-Risk (VaR) figures generated by this engine should not be used for actual capital allocation, regulatory reporting, or investment decisions.
