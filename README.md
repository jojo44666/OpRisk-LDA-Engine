##  Overview
**OpRisk-LDA-Engine** is a quantitative risk modeling framework designed to calculate **Operational Risk Capital** (Economic Capital) using the **Loss Distribution Approach (LDA)**. 

Unlike Market Risk (which models continuous price changes), Operational Risk deals with low-frequency, high-severity events (e.g., Internal Fraud, Cyber Attacks, Litigation). This project implements the industry-standard "Actuarial Approach" favored by Basel III/IV Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) guidelines.

It combines **Frequency distributions** and **Heavy-Tailed Severity distributions** via **Monte Carlo Convolution** to estimate the 99.9% Value at Risk (VaR).

##  Mathematical Framework

The model constructs the **Aggregate Loss Distribution** ($S$) for a specific time horizon (usually 1 year) using the following convolution:

$$S = \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$

Where:
1.  **Frequency ($N$):** The number of loss events per year, modeled as a **Poisson Random Variable**:
    $$P(N=n) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^n}{n!}$$
2.  **Severity ($X_i$):** The monetary loss of each event, modeled using a **Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD)** to capture "Fat Tails" (extreme outliers):
    $$F(x) = 1 - \left( 1 + \xi \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^{-1/\xi}$$
3.  **Convolution:** Since there is no closed-form solution for the sum of a random number of random variables, we use **Monte Carlo Simulation** (1,000,000 iterations) to numerically approximate the distribution of $S$.

##  Features
* **Vectorized Simulation:** Uses NumPy vectorization instead of loops for high-performance Monte Carlo simulations (capable of simulating 1M years in seconds).
* **Heavy-Tail Modeling:** Implements Extreme Value Theory (EVT) concepts by fitting GPD to loss severities.
* **Capital Calculation:** Automatically computes the **Value at Risk (VaR 99.9%)** and **Expected Loss (EL)**.
* **Visualization:** Generates a dashboard showing Frequency, Severity, and the final Capital Distribution.

##   Disclaimer: Educational Use Only
This software is a theoretical implementation of the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA) for Operational Risk modeling. It is intended strictly for educational and research purposes.
Limitations
* 1.	Synthetic Data: The default execution uses synthetically generated loss data (Poisson/Lognormal/Pareto mix) and does not reflect the proprietary loss history of any actual financial institution.
* 2.	Model Risk: While this project utilizes industry-standard distributions (GPD, Poisson), it does not account for correlation between different risk types (Copulas) or external data mixing, which are required for a fully compliant Basel III Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) framework.
* 3.	No Financial Advice: The Value-at-Risk (VaR) figures generated by this engine should not be used for actual capital allocation, regulatory reporting, or investment decisions.
The author assumes no liability for the use of this code in production environments.
